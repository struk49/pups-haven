            <h1>Fresh Breathies</h1>
            <p>
                Fresh Breathies are a chicken flavoured dental dog chew which reduces bad dog breath from inside out. Contains  5 natural ingredients like Spirulina, Parsley and champignon mushrooms which can help get rid of bad dog breath. Fresh breathies supports teeth and healthy gums, a healthy gut and immune function.

My daughter has a dog called willow, he is a white multipoo. He is so little and cute. i picked him up and placed him on my lap and gave him stroke. He wanted to lick my face but his breath put me off getting close to him. My daughter was laughing and said he likes to eat cat poo and is always in the bin and it might be why his breath smells. I asked her what she had been feeding him, he eats everything she said. He's always hovering up everything dropped on the floor. 
            </p>
            <p>
                So i went home and gave my daughter and her dog some thought. I wondered if there was anything i could give him to reduce the smell.  i got the laptop out and looked for something which could help reduce the smell and maybe improve my daughter dog's health. 

I came across Fresh Breathies. These soft dog chews are designed to reduce your dog bad breath from the inside out by supporting a healthy gut and improving your dog's coat. These dog chews are made using no chemicals, wheat or corn.
