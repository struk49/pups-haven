### website has a home page with logo. A navbar with links to other pages. Clicking the logo brings the user to the home page.
'''The users will see the home page with the logo, navbar and footer. I tried to design a site which is interactive and easy to navigate. The colour scheme is consistant throughout the site. The menu abr and links are the same on every page. The user can easiy navigate the site and predict whats goig to happen and can easily learn how to use the site at first gkance.''' 

## If the user can answer yes to these questions. I have acheived what i set out to acheive.
1. Where am i?
2. How did i get here?
3. Where can i go from here?

```I believe the site can be used with signal trail learnin. The site is easy to use and the user can see where a link will take them.```

### When designing the site, i drew up some wireframes. This was so i could get an idea of what the site might look like.
I decided to go with a logo and menu at the top of the page. A footer and the contents in the middle. The images used on the home page i made myself using Canva. The hpme page has a paragragh about the product,. Some images shoeing more information about the product and an offer.
