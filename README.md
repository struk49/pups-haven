# Puphaven is my first project. I have used CSS and HTML to build a three page website.

### ### website has a home page with logo. A navbar with links to other pages. Clicking the logo brings the user to the home page. 
```The Users will see the home page with the main image, menu bar and footer. I tried to design a site which is interactive in design and easy to navigate. The color scheme is consistant through the site. The menu bar the same on all pages in the site. The user can easily navigate around the site and predict -whats going to happen when he or she clicks on a link. The user can easily learn how to use the site at first glance.'''
